\item {\bf GRADING}

\begin {enumerate}
\item {\bf COURSE GRADE}: Your course grade is based on 500 points accumulated as follows:\\

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Written Homework & 50 \\
Online Homework & 50 \\
Classwork & 60 \\
Exam 1 & 80 \\
Exam 2 & 80 \\
Exam 3 & 80 \\
Final Exam & \underline {100} \\ 
& {\bf 500}\\
\end{tabular}

The total sum of points is your numerical score, which will be converted to a letter grade according to the following scale.\\



\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |l l|l l|} 
 \hline
 A  & ~~450 - 500 pts  & C & ~~340 - 359.99 pts\\

{\bf The course grade is determined by the number of \underline{points} you have, not by the percentage, and will be strictly enforced. There will be no additional curve in this course, and extra assignments for individual students to improve a grade are NOT possible.}\\

\item {\bf ONLINE HOMEWORK}: The online homework admistered on WileyPlus is planned to maintain your knowledge of recent material. The online homework assignments must be completed by the specified due date. Your online homework grade will be posted in percentage in WileyPlus, and that much percntage of 50 points will be your score for online homework. \\
The online homework problems are graded by WileyPlus and you see your score immediately after submitting your work. You will have multiple attempts for each problem; there are aids and a link to the e-book to help you solve each question. \\
{\bf Do not try to complete an assignment in one sitting; start early instead of waiting until the due date to avoid missing the deadline. It is very important that you keep up-to-date with the homework.}\\

\item {\bf WRITTEN HOMEWORK}: The written homework assignments will be given at each lecture and must be turned in by the specified due date in class. Your written homework will be graded and returned to you within a week. No late work will be accepted. You must show all your work in order to receive full credit. You may work together on homework but the final product needs to be your own work. \\
{\bf Do not try to complete an assignment in one sitting; start early instead of waiting until the due date to avoid missing the deadline. It is very important that you keep up-to-date with the homework.}\\

\item {\bf QUIZZES}: There will be 8 quizzes in class on the dates listed in the course calendar, and each quiz will be given 10 minutes before the end of the class. Each will be graded on a scale of 0 to 10 points, and the top six scores will count, up to a total of 60 points. The quiz will be based on previous lectures, classwork and homework assignments. Last minute show up to take the quiz will not be allowed. \\

\item {\bf ATTENDANCE}: Frequency of class attendance is discretionary criteria used for the determination of borderline  $\,\pm\,$ grades. \\
